## Overview
The Demand Forecasting Project is a web application designed to predict the future demand for part numbers based on historical data. It provides visualizations of predicted demand trends and allows users to input additional data for more accurate forecasts.

## Problem Statement
**Problem Statement 5: Predictive Analysis for Part Numbers**  
Create a web application that predicts the future demand for part numbers based on historical data. The historical data might be sparse, so the prediction algorithm should be capable of working effectively with limited training data. The system should visualize the predicted demand trends and allow users to input additional data for more accurate predictions. The frontend is developed using React, while the backend is developed using Python.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas
- **Deployment**: Render (Backend), Render (Frontend)

## Features
- Predict future demand based on historical data.
- Visualize demand trends with interactive plots.
- Allow users to add new data for improved prediction accuracy.
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
- Python 3.x (for the backend)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Deployment
- The backend is deployed on **Render**.
- The frontend is deployed on **Render**.
